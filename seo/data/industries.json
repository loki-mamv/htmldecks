    "h1": "Presentation Templates for Healthcare",
    "intro": "Healthcare presentations need to be clear, trustworthy, and accessible on every device in the building. Most slide tools fail on at least one of those. HTML Decks gives you presentations that work on the nurse's station iPad, the board room projector, and the CFO's laptop — without installing anything.",
    "content": "<h2>Why Healthcare Presentations Are Different</h2>\n<p>You're presenting to audiences with wildly different technical literacy — from surgeons who barely open email to IT directors who'll judge your file format. You need data visualization that's clear at a glance, because nobody in a hospital has time to stare at slides.</p>\n\n<p>Traditional presentation tools create problems in healthcare settings. PowerPoint files get blocked by hospital email filters. Google Slides needs internet access that's spotty in half your buildings. And nobody wants to install random software on a locked-down hospital workstation.</p>\n\n<h2>What Healthcare Teams Use HTML Decks For</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Quality improvement presentations</strong> — Track metrics, show trends, present to committees</li>\n<li><strong>Board and leadership updates</strong> — Financial performance, patient outcomes, strategic initiatives</li>\n<li><strong>Staff training</strong> — Onboarding, compliance, clinical protocols that need regular updates</li>\n<li><strong>Patient education</strong> — Condition overviews, treatment plans, discharge instructions</li>\n<li><strong>Grant proposals</strong> — Research funding, community health initiatives</li>\n<li><strong>Conference presentations</strong> — Medical conferences, grand rounds, CME sessions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Works on Hospital Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>HTML files open in any browser. No software to install, no IT tickets to file, no compatibility headaches. Save it to a USB drive, email the file, or host it on your intranet. It works everywhere, including those ancient workstations running Windows 10 that IT won't upgrade.</p>\n\n<h3>Data-Friendly Templates</h3>\n<p>Healthcare runs on data. Our templates include clean layouts for metrics dashboards, trend charts, and outcome comparisons. Present patient satisfaction scores, readmission rates, or financial KPIs without spending hours fighting with chart formatting.</p>",
    "faqs": [
      {"q": "Are HTML Decks presentations HIPAA compliant?", "a": "HTML Decks creates files that live on your own infrastructure — your computer, your intranet, your shared drive. Since there's no cloud storage or third-party server involved, you control the data. Don't put PHI in any presentation, but the format itself doesn't create HIPAA exposure."},
      {"q": "Can I use these templates for medical conference presentations?", "a": "Yes. HTML presentations work on any projector or display system. They're actually more reliable than PowerPoint for conferences because there's no font substitution or compatibility issues. Open the file, present. That's it."},
      {"q": "Will these work on hospital computers that restrict software installs?", "a": "Yes — that's one of the biggest advantages. HTML files open in any web browser, which is already on every hospital computer. No admin rights needed, no IT approval required."},
      {"q": "Can I share these presentations with patients?", "a": "Absolutely. HTML files work on phones, tablets, and computers. You can email patients a single file they open in any browser. Great for patient education materials or treatment plan overviews."}

    "content": "<h2>Built for How SaaS Teams Actually Work</h2>\n<p>Your sales team needs decks they can customize fast. Your CEO needs investor updates that look professional without a designer. Your product team needs launch decks that work in Zoom screen shares. Different needs, same requirement: presentations that look great with minimal effort.</p>\n\n<p>Most SaaS companies bounce between Google Slides (collaborative but generic), Keynote (beautiful but Mac-only), and PowerPoint (universal but ugly). HTML Decks gives you the best of all three: professional design, universal compatibility, and one-link sharing.</p>\n\n<h2>SaaS Presentation Use Cases</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product demos</strong> — Walk prospects through your platform with styled, branded slides</li>\n<li><strong>Investor pitches</strong> — Clean metrics, growth charts, and the story that gets you funded</li>\n<li><strong>Customer onboarding</strong> — Welcome decks that work on any device your customers use</li>\n<li><strong>Board meetings</strong> — Quarterly updates with financial dashboards and KPIs</li>\n<li><strong>Sales enablement</strong> — Battlecards, case studies, and competitive positioning</li>\n<li><strong>All-hands meetings</strong> — Company updates that keep remote teams aligned</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Share a Link, Not an Attachment</h2>\n<p>SaaS buyers expect links, not attachments. When you send a prospect a clean URL instead of a .pptx file, you look more professional. They can view it on any device, share it with their team, and you can track when they open it.</p>\n\n<h3>Metrics That Pop</h3>\n<p>SaaS is a numbers game — MRR, churn, CAC, LTV. Our templates are designed to make metrics visual and compelling. Growth charts that actually look good. Comparison tables that tell a story. Financial summaries that boards can parse in seconds.</p>",

Professional, clear, and accessible to every employee on every device — because HR content needs to reach everyone, not just people with laptops.</p>\n\n<h2>HR & Recruiting Presentation Use Cases</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employee onboarding</strong> — Welcome decks, culture overview, policies, and procedures</li>\n<li><strong>Benefits enrollment</strong> — Plan options, deadlines, and key changes</li>\n<li><strong>Recruiting pitches</strong> — Employer brand, culture, and role overviews</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership training</strong> — Management skills, performance review guidance, compliance</li>\n<li><strong>Policy updates</strong> — New policies and procedures explained clearly</li>\n<li><strong>All-hands HR updates</strong> — Annual reviews, engagement survey results, initiatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Reach Every Employee</h2>\n<p>HR content needs to be accessible to everyone — the office worker on a laptop, the warehouse worker on a phone, the remote employee on a tablet. HTML presentations work on every device without installing anything. Send a link, everyone has access.</p>\n\n<h3>Update Once, Share Everywhere</h3>\n<p>Benefits change. Policies evolve. When your presentation is HTML, update the source once and every link automatically shows the latest version. No more hunting down old PDFs floating around in email chains.</p>",
