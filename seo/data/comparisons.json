But when it comes to presentations that need to work reliably, share cleanly, and look professional years from now, Canva's model starts showing cracks. HTML Decks takes a fundamentally different approach — one file, no account, no internet required. Here's how they compare.",
    "content": "<h2>The Core Difference</h2>\n<p>Canva is a cloud design tool that happens to make presentations. HTML Decks is a presentation format designed from the ground up for reliability and portability. That difference matters more than you might think.</p>\n\n<p>With Canva, your presentation lives on Canva's servers. You need internet to access it. You need an account to edit it. If Canva changes their pricing, their terms, or their platform, you're affected. If they shut down a feature, your existing presentations might break.</p>\n\n<p>HTML Decks creates a single file you own completely. Open it in any browser, on any device, forever.

The \"Prezi look\" became as clichéd as the PowerPoint templates it replaced.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the format prioritized spectacle over substance. Great presentations aren't remembered for their animations — they're remembered for their ideas. HTML Decks puts the focus back where it belongs: your content.</p>\n\n<h2>Feature Comparison</h2>\n<table class=\"comparison-table\">\n<tr><th>Feature</th><th>HTML Decks</th><th>Prezi</th></tr>\n<tr><td>Price</td><td class=\"check\">✓ $29 one-time</td><td class=\"cross\">✗ $7-59/mo</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Works offline</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Always</td><td class=\"partial\">⚠ Desktop app</td></tr>\n<tr><td>File ownership</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Your files</td><td class=\"cross\">✗ Cloud platform</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Motion effects</td><td class=\"partial\">⚠ Subtle transitions</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Zoom/pan</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Audience reaction</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Content-focused</td><td class=\"partial\">⚠ Can distract</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Professional context</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Appropriate everywhere</td><td class=\"partial\">⚠ Can feel gimmicky</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Account required</td><td class=\"check\">✓ No</td><td class=\"cross\">✗ Required</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Learning curve</td><td class=\"check\">✓ Use templates</td><td class=\"cross\">✗ Non-linear paradigm</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2>The Distraction Problem</h2>\n<p>When you're presenting to investors, clients, or your board, you want them focused on what you're saying — not on the swoopy animations. Prezi's format draws attention to itself. HTML Decks stays out of the way and lets your content speak.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Choose HTML Decks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You want audiences focused on content, not animations</li>\n<li>You present in professional contexts where gimmicks feel inappropriate</li>\n<li>You prefer clean, structured slides</li>\n<li>You want to own your files without subscriptions</li>\n<li>You don't want to learn a completely different presentation paradigm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When to Choose Prezi</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You're presenting educational content where the canvas metaphor helps</li>\n<li>Your audience genuinely hasn't seen Prezi and it would be novel</li>\n<li>You're doing creative, artistic presentations where spectacle is the point</li>\n<li>Non-linear navigation genuinely serves your content</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Prezi is a solution to a problem most presentations don't have. For the vast majority of professional presentations, clean slides work better than zooming canvases. HTML Decks gives you that — professional, focused, distraction-free.</p>",
    "faqs": [
      {"q": "Is Prezi's zooming effect ever useful?", "a": "For certain educational content or creative presentations, the non-linear canvas can help. But for standard business presentations — pitches, reports, proposals — it's usually more distraction than enhancement."},
      {"q": "Why did Prezi become seen as gimmicky?", "a": "Overuse. When Prezi was new, the zoom was impressive. But audiences saw too many presentations where the motion was the only memorable thing. The effect stopped being novel and started being expected."},
      {"q": "Can HTML Decks do any animations?", "a": "HTML Decks supports CSS transitions — subtle fades and slides. These are enough to feel polished without becoming a distraction. The focus stays on your content."},
      {"q": "Is Prezi still used in professional settings?", "a": "Occasionally, but it's less common than it was in 2012-2015. Most professionals have returned to slide-based presentations. HTML Decks fits that expectation with better execution."}

    "content": "<h2>The Startup Tax</h2>\n<p>Slidebean has smartly positioned itself in the startup ecosystem. They offer pitch deck consulting, template design, and an AI platform — all at premium prices. If you're raising millions, $200 for a template seems trivial. But most startups are bootstrapping, and every dollar matters.</p>\n\n<p>HTML Decks provides professional pitch deck templates for $29 one-time.

But if you just need good templates? That's what HTML Decks provides.</p>\n\n<h2>When to Choose HTML Decks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You want a one-time purchase, not a subscription</li>\n<li>You can create your own pitch deck without consulting</li>\n<li>You prefer owning files over cloud platforms</li>\n<li>Your budget is limited and every dollar counts</li>\n<li>You want templates for multiple use cases, not just pitches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>When to Choose Slidebean</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You want hands-on help with your pitch deck content</li>\n<li>You need the specific Slidebean templates you've seen</li>\n<li>View tracking and analytics are essential for your fundraise</li>\n<li>Budget isn't your primary constraint</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Slidebean has built a smart business around startup fundraising.

    "faqs": [
      {"q": "Is Slidebean's AI content assistance worth the price?", "a": "If you have no idea how to structure a pitch deck, it provides guidance. But the basic structure is well-documented online for free. HTML Decks includes a pitch template with the standard sections already defined."},

      {"q": "Does Slidebean have view tracking for investors?", "a": "Yes. You can see when investors view your deck and which slides they spend time on. If that analytics feature is critical to your fundraising process, it's a genuine advantage."},
      {"q": "How do the templates compare?", "a": "Both offer professional pitch deck templates. Slidebean's are designed around their platform. HTML Decks' are standalone files you own. The visual quality is comparable."}

    "content": "<h2>AI Generation vs. Human Creation</h2>\n<p>Gamma represents one possible future of presentations: tell AI what you want, and it builds the deck for you. For quick internal communications or brainstorming, that's useful. But for presentations that matter — pitches, sales, board meetings — AI-generated content feels generic because it is generic.</p>\n\n<p>HTML Decks templates provide structure and design.

    "faqs": [
      {"q": "Can Gamma create a good pitch deck automatically?", "a": "It can create a pitch deck structure with placeholder content. But the actual pitch — your story, your metrics, your vision — still needs to come from you. At that point, you might as well start with a template."},

      {"q": "What's Gamma's advantage over templates?", "a": "Speed. If you need something fast and don't care about depth, AI generation is faster than filling in templates. But for presentations worth doing well, the time investment in real content pays off."},
      {"q": "Can I use Gamma to start and then customize?", "a": "Yes, but heavy customization often takes as long as starting from a template. And you're still dependent on Gamma's platform for the base file."}
