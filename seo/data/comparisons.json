You need internet to access your stuff, and you're locked into their ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>HTML Decks gives you a file you own. One HTML file, works anywhere, forever. No subscription, no login, no internet required after download.</p>\n\n<h2>Where Canva wins</h2>\n<p>Let's be fair — Canva does some things well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Graphic design flexibility</strong> — full-featured design tool with tons of options</li>\n<li><strong>Stock assets</strong> — huge library of photos, illustrations, icons</li>\n<li><strong>Team collaboration</strong> — real-time editing with multiple people</li>\n<li><strong>Template variety</strong> — thousands of templates for every format</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Where HTML Decks wins</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Offline presentation</strong> — present anywhere without wifi or cellular</li>\n<li><strong>True ownership</strong> — files are yours, no subscription required to access</li>\n<li><strong>No account needed</strong> — download, edit, present. That's it</li>\n<li><strong>One-time price</strong> — $29 once vs. $13-15/month for Canva Pro</li>\n<li><strong>Universal compatibility</strong> — works in any browser, any device, any OS</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong> — nothing uploads anywhere, your content stays local</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The presentation-specific problems with Canva</h2>\n<p>Canva is a general design tool — presentations are just one of many things it does. That creates some friction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Presentation mode requires internet</li>\n<li>Exported PDFs don't have transitions or interactivity</li>\n<li>Files get stuck if your subscription lapses</li>\n<li>Sharing requires either Canva links or large file exports</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The pricing math</h3>\n<p>Canva Pro is $13/month ($120/year). After one year, you've paid 4x what HTML Decks costs. After two years, 8x. And if you stop paying, you lose access to Pro features and your files may be affected.</p>\n\n<p>HTML Decks is $29 once.

      {"q": "Is Gamma free?", "a": "Free tier exists with limits on AI credits and features. Useful features require subscription."},
      {"q": "When should I use AI-generated presentations?", "a": "Internal decks, quick brainstorming, first drafts. Not for investor pitches, client presentations, or anything where generic content hurts you."}

    "intro": "Slides.com also uses HTML (powered by reveal.js). It's a solid tool — but it's cloud-based and subscription-priced. Same tech, different model.",
    "content": "<h2>HTML presentations, different approaches</h2>\n<p>Slides.com and HTML Decks both output HTML presentations. The difference: Slides.com is a cloud platform you pay monthly for. HTML Decks gives you templates you own.</p>\n\n<h2>Where Slides.com wins</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Online editor</strong> — build in the browser with visual tools</li>\n<li><strong>Team features</strong> — collaboration, commenting, workspaces</li>\n<li><strong>Hosting</strong> — automatic hosting for sharing</li>\n<li><strong>Developer features</strong> — API access, custom CSS/JS</li>\n<li><strong>Analytics</strong> — view tracking on shared decks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Where HTML Decks wins</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> — $29 once vs. $5-14/month for Slides.com</li>\n<li><strong>File ownership</strong> — download and own your HTML files</li>\n<li><strong>No platform dependency</strong> — files work independently</li>\n<li><strong>Offline first</strong> — present and edit without internet</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy</strong> — nothing on external servers</li>\n<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> — no account, no login, just files</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The ownership question</h2>\n<p>Slides.com presentations live on their platform. You can export, but the workflow centers on their cloud. HTML Decks gives you the file immediately — it's yours.</p>\n\n<h3>Similar output, different model</h3>\n<p>Both produce HTML presentations that work in browsers. The question is whether you want to rent a platform or own templates. For ongoing presentation needs, Slides.com's editor has value. For occasional use, HTML Decks' one-time price makes more sense.</p>",
    "faqs": [
      {"q": "Is Slides.com similar to HTML Decks?", "a": "Same underlying tech (HTML presentations), different delivery. Slides.com is a platform you subscribe to. HTML Decks is templates you buy once."},
      {"q": "Can I export from Slides.com to HTML?", "a": "Yes, paid plans allow HTML export. But the workflow is cloud-first. HTML Decks is local-first."},
      {"q": "Which has better templates?", "a": "Slides.com has more templates, but they're platform-locked. HTML Decks templates are fewer but fully owned."},
      {"q": "Do developers prefer Slides.com?", "a": "Some do — the API and custom code features are good. But developers who want full control often prefer raw HTML templates they can modify directly."}
