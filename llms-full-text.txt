# HTML Decks — Full Site Summary

## What It Is
HTML Decks is a set of 16 premium HTML presentation templates sold as a one-time $29 purchase. Each template is a single HTML file that opens in any browser, works offline, and can be edited directly — no software required.

## The Problem It Solves
PowerPoint files break on other machines. Google Slides needs internet. Canva costs $20/month. Presentation software creates dependency on specific apps, accounts, and internet connections. HTML files just work — any browser, any device, forever.

## How It Works
1. Choose a template (or use the free Startup Pitch template)
2. Open the HTML file in any browser
3. Edit text directly — everything is contentEditable
4. Present in fullscreen (F11) or share the file
5. Optional: use the online editor at htmldecks.com for a visual Canva-like experience

## Templates Available (16 Premium)
1. Startup Pitch — Clean, modern pitch deck for fundraising
2. Corporate Blue — Professional business presentations
3. Neon Cyber — Bold dark theme with neon accents
4. Aurora Borealis — Gradient-rich, atmospheric design
