      <p class="article__intro">We've seen hundreds of pitch decks. Most are terrible. Here's exactly what investors want to see, slide by slide.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="article__content">
      <p>Last month, I watched a founder present to a room full of VCs. Great product, solid traction, experienced team. But 3 slides in, you could see phones coming out. By slide 8, half the room was checking email.</p>

      <p>The problem? Their pitch deck violated every rule in the book. They buried the ask, started with product features instead of the problem, and spent 4 slides on technology architecture that no investor cared about.</p>

      <p><strong>Here's the truth:</strong> You have about 30 seconds to hook an investor. Maybe less. If they're not leaning forward by slide 3, you've lost them.</p>

      <p>After analyzing 500+ successful pitch decks and sitting through countless pitch sessions, here's the exact formula that gets investors to pay attention.</p>

      <h2>The 10 Essential Slides (In Order)</h2>

      <h3>Slide 1: The Hook</h3>
      <p>Skip the agenda. Skip the thank you. Lead with your strongest statement. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"We're saving Fortune 500 companies $2M per year on something they don't even know they're wasting money on"</li>
        <li>"3 billion people can't access banking. We've figured out how to serve them profitably"</li>
        <li>"Uber for X is dead. This is Uber for reality"</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Slide 2: The Problem</h3>
      <p>Paint the pain. Make it personal. Use real numbers when possible. The mistake most founders make? They describe a problem they <em>think</em> exists rather than one they <em>know</em> exists.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Software teams waste 40% of their time waiting for code reviews. That's 2 full days per week of your best engineers scrolling Twitter instead of building."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Slide 3: The Solution</h3>
      <p>Keep it simple. One sentence if possible. If you need a paragraph to explain your solution, it's either too complex or you don't understand it well enough.</p>

      <p>Good: "AI-powered code reviews that happen instantly"<br>
      Bad: "A machine learning platform leveraging natural language processing and predictive analytics to optimize the software development lifecycle through automated peer review mechanisms"</p>

      <h3>Slide 4: Market Size</h3>
      <p>TAM/SAM/SOM is played out. Instead, show your path to $100M ARR. Break it down:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1M potential customers</li>
        <li>$100/month average</li>
        <li>10% market capture = $100M ARR</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Slide 5: Traction</h3>
      <p>This is where you prove you're not just another idea. Show hockey stick growth with the metric that matters most:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue (best)</li>
        <li>Paying customers (second best)</li>
        <li>Active users (if there's a clear path to revenue)</li>
        <li>Pilot customers and LOIs (pre-revenue)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Slide 6: Business Model</h3>
      <p>How you make money. Be specific. "$50/user/month" not "SaaS subscription model." Include your unit economics if they're good (LTV/CAC ratio above 3:1).</p>

      <h3>Slide 7: Competition</h3>
      <p>Never say "we have no competition." You always have competition, even if it's Excel spreadsheets. Show you understand the landscape and have a defensible position.</p>

      <h3>Slide 8: Team</h3>
      <p>Why are YOU the team to solve this? Focus on relevant experience, not just impressive titles. The CTO who built similar systems at scale is more relevant than the advisor who founded a different type of company.</p>

      <h3>Slide 9: The Ask</h3>
      <p>Be specific. "$2M to reach $10M ARR in 18 months" is better than "$2M Series A." Include what you'll use the money for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>60% engineering (10 new hires)</li>
        <li>25% sales & marketing</li>
        <li>15% operations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Slide 10: Vision</h3>
      <p>Paint the picture of success. Where is this company in 5 years? How does it change the world? This is where you get investors excited about the upside.</p>

      <h2>The Fatal Mistakes</h2>

      <h3>1. Starting with product demo</h3>
      <p>We've seen decks that dive into product screenshots on slide 2. Problem: investors don't care about your features until they understand why this matters.</p>

      <h3>2. Burying the ask</h3>
      <p>Some founders mention funding on slide 15. By then, investors have mentally moved on. State your ask early and clearly.</p>

      <h3>3. Too much text</h3>
      <p>If you're reading your slides word for word, you've lost the room. One key point per slide. Use visuals, charts, and bullet points.</p>

      <h3>4. Generic market research</h3>
      <p>"The market for X is $50B" means nothing. Show YOUR path to capturing a piece of that market with specific customers and use cases.</p>

      <h3>5. No clear competitive advantage</h3>
      <p>"We're first to market" isn't a sustainable advantage. Network effects, patent protection, unique data, or exceptional team execution are.</p>

      <h2>What Investors Actually Think</h2>

      <p>I asked 5 VCs what they look for in the first 3 slides:</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Chen, Benchmark:</strong> "I need to understand the problem immediately. If I'm confused about what you're solving, I'm not listening to your solution."</p>

      <p><strong>Mike Rodriguez, a16z:</strong> "Show me you have an unfair advantage. Either in distribution, product, team, or market timing. Something that makes you hard to copy."</p>

      <p><strong>Lisa Park, First Round:</strong> "Traction tells me everything. I can forgive a mediocre pitch if the numbers are growing and to the right."</p>

      <h2>The 10-20-30 Rule</h2>

      <p>Guy Kawasaki's famous rule still applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 slides maximum for the main pitch</li>
        <li>20 minutes to present (save time for questions)</li>
        <li>30pt font minimum (forces you to be concise)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Have backup slides for deep dives, but keep your main presentation tight and focused.</p>

      <h2>Before You Pitch</h2>

      <p>Test your pitch deck on someone who knows nothing about your business. If they can't explain your company back to you after seeing it once, simplify.</p>

      <p>Practice until you can deliver it without slides. The deck supports your story; it doesn't tell the story for you.</p>

      <p>Remember: you're not trying to get funding from your pitch deck. You're trying to get the next meeting. Focus on generating interest and questions, not closing the deal.</p>
